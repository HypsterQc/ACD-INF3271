# INF3271 // Teleinformatics

In the INF3271 course, I study the fundamentals of teleinformatics networks, including the OSI and TCP/IP models. I become familiar with protocols (HTTP, FTP, TCP, UDP, etc.), IP addressing, data transmission, and mobile networks. Through practical assignments, I use Wireshark to analyze packets and Cisco tools to better understand communication between services and network layers.
